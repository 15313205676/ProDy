SYNOPSIS
--------

ProDy is a Python package for analyzing protein structural dynamics, 
designed and developed by Ahmet Bakan in Bahar lab. New functional features 
are continually being added to ProDy. The following are the main features 
that have been suffessfully implemented to date:

**Examination and analysis of structural variability observed in experiments:**

  * Efficient parsing of PDB files
  * Powerful selection of atoms and interactions
  * Matching, superposing, and comparing multiple structures/chains
  * Principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray structures
  * PCA of NMR models

**Prediction and analysis of protein dynamics using theory and simulation:**

  * Normal Mode Analysis using the Anisotropic network model (ANM)
  * Gaussian network model (GNM) analysis
  * Essential dynamics analysis (EDA) of MD snapshots
  * Comparative analysis and visualization of dynamics
