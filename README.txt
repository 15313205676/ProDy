**SYNOPSIS**

ProDy is a Python package designed for protein structural dynamics analysis. 
New features and functions are constantly being added to ProDy. 
The following are the main features that are present and working fine:

Protein structure analysis:
  * a fast PDB file parser
  * a powerful atom selector and intermolecular contact finder
  * functions for matching and comparing polypeptide chains
Normal mode analysis (NMA):
  * elastic network models (Anisotropic/Gaussian network models)
  * PCA of X-ray structures, NMR models, MD snapshots
  * functions for comparative NMA, i.e. calculate/plot overlaps
