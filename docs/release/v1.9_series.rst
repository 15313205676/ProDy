  * Identification of structural domains using spectral clustering.

**New Features**:

*Perturbation Response Scanning*

  * Perturbation Response Scanning method is fully implemented with 
    new plotting tools. 

  * Effectors and sensors are calculated from PRS tool. 

*Visualization with py3Dmol*

  * In jupyter notebook, if you have installed py3Dmol you can use
  py3Dmol visualization directly instead of simple matplotlib 
  visualization. 

*mmcif parser*

  * Another structural format cif is also a part of ProDy parser now. 

*Bugfixes*

  * Various indexing issues are fixed. 

  * Some of the obsolete pdbs will not be downloaded anymore, instead
