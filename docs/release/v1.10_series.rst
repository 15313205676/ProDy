Signature Dynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Added :func:`.calcEnsembleENMs` to compute ENMs on each conformation of a 
  given ensemble to obtain an ensemble of modes.

  * Added :class:`.ModeEnsemble` and :class:`.sdarray` classes as the basic 
  data types for signature dynamics.

  * Added functions such as :func:`.calcSignatureSqFlucts`, 
  :func:`.calcSignatureCrossCorr`, :func:`.calcSignatureFractVariance` to 
  extract signature dynamics.

  * Added :func:`.calcEnsembleSpectralOverlaps` to obtain dynamical 
  overlaps/distances among the conformations in a given ensemble.


**New Features**:

*Visualization*

  * Added :func:`.showAtomicLines` and :func:`.showAtomicMatrix` functions to 
  improve visualization.

  * Added an *networkx* option to :func:`.showTree` so that the user can choose 
  to use :mod:`~networkx` to visualize a given tree.


*Ensemble and PDBEnsemble*

  * Associated an :class:`.MSA` object to the :class:`.PDBEnsemble` class.

  * Added an *pairwise* option to :meth:`.Ensemble.getRMSDs` to obtain an 
  RMSD table of every pair of conformations in the ensemble.

  * Improved :meth:`.Ensemble.setAtoms` for selecting a subset of 
  residues/atoms of the ensemble.

*Databases and Web Services*

  * Added methods and classes for obtaining data from *CATH* and *Dali*.
  
  * Added additional functions for *Uniprot* and *Pfam* such as 
  :func:`.queryUniprot` and :func:`.parsePfamPDBs`.

*Bug Fixes and Improvements*

  * Fixed compatibility problems for Python 2 and 3.

  * Improved the :func:`.saveModel` function to include class-specific features.

  * Fixed a bug related to the :class:`.Atomgroup` addition method.

  * Bug fixes to :class:`.NMA` classes.

  * Fixed a problem with :class:`.MSA` indexing.

  * Reorganized file structures and functions for consistency. 

  * Other bug fixes.
