Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz) is a `VMD <www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ 
plug-in designed for visual and comparative analysis of normal mode data, 
i.e. modes from principal component, essential dynamics, or normal mode analysis. 

NMWiz can be used for:

  * visualizing normal modes with arrows
  * generating alternate conformations along a normal mode (animation)
  * plotting squared-fluctuations (allows labeling and highlighting residues)
  * comparative analysis of normal modes from different sources/methods
  * preparing publication quality images of normal modes with the power of 
  
NMWiz makes adjusting the representation of normal modes and the protein 
as easy as it should be. See some examples on the side panel.

NMWiz recognizes Normal Mode Data format (.nmd).  NMD files can be 
generated using ProDy or obtained from the 
`ANM server <http:/www.csb.pitt.edu/ANM/>`_.  Alternatively, you can prepare 
your results in NMD format for analysis with NMWiz. NMD is a simple plain text 
format and can even be prepared easily using text editor. See 
:ref:`nmdformat` for details.
