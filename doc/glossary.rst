   DCD
     NAMD produces DCD trajectory files in the same format as X-PLOR and CHARMM. 
     The DCD files are single precision binary FORTRAN files, so are transportable 
     between computer architectures. Source:

   NMD
     NMD stands for Normal Mode Data, and it is the extension used by files
     containing NMD. It is a plain-text file format recognized 
     by the Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz), a VMD plug-in for visualizing NMD.
     For a description of this file format see: 
     :ref:`nmd-format`
     
   PDB 
     A PDB file contains atomic data including, e.g. coordinates, and
     other structural and meta data. The best guide to PDB format can
     be found here: http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/format32/v3.2.html 
     
   PSF
     A PSF file, also called a protein structure file, contains atomic and
     molecular information necessary for applying a particular force field
     to the molecular system. This file type is used by molecular dynamics
     simulation software, including CHARMM and NAMD. More information
     can be found: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/namd-tutorial-unix-html/node21.html
