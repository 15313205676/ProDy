Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz) is a VMD plugin for depiction, animation, and 
comparative analysis of normal modes.  Normal modes may come from principal 
component of structural ensembles, essential dynamics analysis of simulation
trajectories, or normal mode analysis of protein structures.  In addition,
NMWiz can be used to describe any vector that describes a molecular motion.
