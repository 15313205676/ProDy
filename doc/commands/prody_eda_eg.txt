This command performs PCA calculations for given multi-model PDB
structure or DCD format trajectory file and outputs results in NMD
format. If a PDB identifier is given, structure file will be
downloaded from the PDB FTP \
server. DCD files may be accompanied with PDB or PSF files to enable
atoms \
selections.

Fetch pdb 2k39, perform PCA calculations, and output NMD file:

  $ prody pca 2k39

Fetch pdb 2k39 and perform calculations for backbone of residues up to
71,
and save all output and figure files:

  $ prody pca 2k39 --select "backbone and resnum < 71" -a -A
