This command performs PCA (or EDA) calculations for given multi-model
PDB structure or DCD format trajectory file and outputs results in NMD
format.  If a PDB identifier is given, structure file will be
downloaded from the PDB  FTP server.  DCD files may be accompanied
with PDB or PSF files to enable atoms selections.

Fetch pdb 2k39, perform PCA calculations, and output NMD file:

  $ prody pca 2k39

Fetch pdb 2k39 and perform calculations for backbone of residues up to
71, and save all output and figure files:

  $ prody pca 2k39 --select "backbone and resnum < 71" -a -A

Perform EDA of MDM2 trajectory:

  $ prody eda mdm2.dcd

Perform EDA for backbone atoms:

  $ prody eda mdm2.dcd --pdb mdm2.pdb --select backbone
