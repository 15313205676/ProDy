This command performs GNM calculations for given PDB structure and
outputs results in NMD format. If an identifier is passed, structure
file will be downloaded from the PDB FTP server.

Fetch PDB 1p38, run GNM calculations using default parameters, and
results:

  $ prody gnm 1p38

Fetch PDB 1aar, run GNM calculations with cutoff distance 7 angstrom
for chain A carbon alpha atoms with residue numbers less than 70, and
save all of the graphical output files:

  $ prody gnm 1aar -c 7 -s "calpha and chain A and resnum < 70" -A
