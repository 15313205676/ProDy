Align models in PDB structure or multiple PDB structures and save
aligned coordinate sets.  When multiple structures are aligned, ProDy
will match chains and use best match for aligning the structures.
Note that options are not used when aligning multiple structures.

Fetch PDB structure 2k39 and align models:

    $ prody align 2k39

Fetch PDB structure 2k39 and align models using backbone of residues
with number smaller than 71:

    $ prody align 2k39 --select "backbone and resnum < 71"

Fetch PDB structures 1p38, 1r39 and 1zz2 and superpose 1r39 and 1zz2
onto 1p38:

    $ prody align 1p38 1r39 1zz2
